# Global Rules for Rippling OS

## Branch Model
- Everyone works on `main` branch
- User data is isolated in the **database**, not via git branches
- No more `user/*` branches - this is legacy

## File Safety
- NEVER edit `context/global/` without explicit user approval
- NEVER commit credentials, secrets, or `.env` files
- ALWAYS respect `.gitignore` patterns
- Use `/ingest-context` to add files to context (via `context/import/` staging folder)

## Data Model
- **Projects, queries, reports, and dashboards are stored in the database**
- Each user's data is linked to their account (by git email)

## Git Workflow
1. Run `/setup` to configure environment and create your database user
2. Create projects with `/create-project` (saves to database)
3. Run queries with `/query` (saves to database)
4. Create reports with `/report` (saves to database)
5. View your work at `/projects/[slug]` in the web app

## Environment
- User email comes from `git config user.email`
- Must be `@rippling.com` email
- `RIPPLING_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` in `.env` is used for Snowflake SSO

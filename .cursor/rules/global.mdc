# Global Rules for Rippling OS

## Branch Safety
- NEVER commit directly to main branch
- ALWAYS work on user branch (user/[email-prefix])
- NEVER delete other users' branches
- ALWAYS use `/save` or `scripts/save.sh` to commit changes

## File Safety
- NEVER modify files in other users' project folders
- NEVER edit `context/global/` without explicit user approval
- NEVER commit credentials, secrets, or `.env` files
- ALWAYS respect `.gitignore` patterns

## Project Structure
- User projects live in `projects/[project-name]/`
- Each project should have:
  - `README.md` - Project description
  - `queries/` - SQL query files
  - `data/` - Cached JSON results
  - `dashboard.yaml` - Dashboard configuration

## Git Workflow
1. Run `/setup` to create your user branch
2. Create projects with `/create-project`
3. Run queries with `/query` to cache results as JSON
4. Save work with `/save` to commit and push
5. Sync with main using `/update-os`

## Environment
- User email is in `RIPPLING_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` env var
- Branch name format: `user/[email-prefix]` (e.g., `user/will.smith`)
- Preview URL format: `https://rippling-os-2-git-user-[name].vercel.app`

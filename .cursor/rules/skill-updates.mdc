# Skill Update Rule

When creating, modifying, or deleting skills or command scripts, update the `/help` skill to reflect the changes.

## Checklist

After modifying any skill or script:

1. **If adding a new command skill**: Add it to the "ALL COMMANDS" section in `.cursor/skills/help/SKILL.md`
2. **If adding a new utility skill**: Add it to the "UTILITY SKILLS" section
3. **If adding a new shell script**: Add it to the "SHELL SCRIPTS" section
4. **If removing a skill/script**: Remove it from the help skill
5. **If renaming a skill/script**: Update the name in the help skill
6. **If changing a skill's trigger or purpose**: Update its description in help

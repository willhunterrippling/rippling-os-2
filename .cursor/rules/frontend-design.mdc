# Frontend Design Standards

Create distinctive interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER Use)

- **Fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, generic sans-serifs
- **Colors**: Purple gradients on white, safe corporate palettes
- **Layouts**: Predictable, cookie-cutter patterns lacking character

## Typography

- Choose characterful, distinctive fonts
- Pair a display font with a refined body font
- Avoid overused defaults

## Color & Theme

- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic direction
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > evenly-distributed palettes

## Spatial Composition

Create unexpected layouts:
- Asymmetry and overlap
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

## Visual Details

Add atmosphere and depth:
- Gradient meshes, noise textures
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, grain overlays

## Motion

- Prioritize CSS-only animations
- Focus on high-impact moments (page load, scroll-trigger, hover)
- Use `animation-delay` for staggered reveals

## Guiding Principle

**Intentionality over intensity**: Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work. The key is a clear aesthetic point-of-view executed with precision.
